# About AR
AR is Augmented Reality. We superimpose images over the top of your phone's camera picture to make it look as though they are placed in the real world.

## How to use it
Download the AR experience, by tapping on the link provided by the map pin. Then, hold your phone up so you can see the world through the screen and then move around until you can see our AR object, an 
apparition from the past.

## Your Phone
Your phone is amazing: it will download the AR experience from the internet, and then provide readings from its compass, orientation and location sensors so the scene is drawn in the right place, to provide the illusion of walking around an object.

Because the AR experience is downloaded from the internet, your phone should ask you for permission to let it access all of these capabilities. Expect it to pop up a few questions before you're able to continue.

Our website supports later versions of Android and iOS and has been tested on iPhone 6s and Google Pixel 3a. Newer phones have more advanced navigation features and can pinpoint their position very accurately. On older phones, you may see the AR wobble. This is because the phone is getting lower accuracy postion readings which may jump around a little.
